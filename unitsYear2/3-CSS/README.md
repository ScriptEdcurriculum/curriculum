#Project 3 - CSS Mastery
![lesson.png](Lesson Sample)

##Scope
This lesson reiterates the fundamentals of CSS then advances into more sophisticated, commonly used techniques. It uses a single-page sandbox that mimics a standard website content page. 

Students will see how CSS refactoring can self-teach new techniques and concepts.  The scope of their CSS abilties will grow.  Mastery, of course, takes a long time and changes as the specifications of CSS change.  However this self-teaching pattern will give students a strong approach to acquiring new expertise with CSS.


#Before Class
Coding is a progression of tagged commits to this repo, to enable diff-based reminders and a talk-aloud lesson (I hope).  Students can choose to use their own editing space but the git repo should be sufficient for the instructor to step through the lesson.

##Vocabulary
* **CSS** - Cascading StyleSheets, the 'decoration' layer of front-end technologies
* **presentation** - the visual design layer of front-end coding, to make it easier for humans to see and interact with your page
* **semantic markup** - tagging markup in a machine- and human-readable way, helping group concepts and keep markup simple
* **shorthand** - compressed collections of related CSS arguments into shorter expressions, for clarity
* **refactoring** - rewriting previous code with attention paid to readability, simplicity and performance
* **CSS3** - the current, mostly supported specification for CSS, with growing browser support
* **animations**, transitions, transforms - CSS3 additions that move some powerful effects into simple(r) presentation than JavaScript, helping keep effects consistent and efficient across different devices
* **responsive web design** - using advanced CSS rulesets to target different screen sizes, like the difference between phones and desktop screens
* **dev tools** - the browser-specific set of development tools to help diagnose issues or test changes, and even emulate different devices (cool new thing)

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Technical Vocabulary:**  
While completing this project the student will get a sense of current CSS practices and see mechanisms to extend their current skills forward, as needed.

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will explore the possibilities within CSS3 with each other's encouragement.

**Version Control:**   
While completing this project the student will see some examples of how to use version control to explore their code refactoring.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will learn common approaches and tips for refactoring presentation-layer code, largely via CSS.

**Search Engine Skills:**  
While completing this project the student will gain further experience with using Google and coding-oriented community sites to learn more CSS tips and tricks.

**Command Line:**  
Not directly applicable.

**Debugging**  
While completing this project the student will learn common approaches to simulating CSS changes and tips for prototyping changes using browser tools.

##Web Programming Skills
This project improves student's web programming skills somewhat outside the traditional rubric, focusing on enhancing their presentation skills and tools to iterate via CSS.


##Year One Review
This project will improve upon the following skills from the [Year 1 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AobNdyExPHV5dGRWMVI0QVpnSWYtczZZT2ZyV01kcmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)  
~~A note to curriculum writers: Do not worry about this section, Tom will complete this at a later date.~~  


#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they should set up a JSBin space for the day's tinkering and be ready to collectively remind the instructor what they recall of CSS so far, as a group.

##Opening
This lesson will provide a refresher for students on web presentation driven by CSS, introduce them to advanced techniques and ways to teach themselves more as they work through other projects.

##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics.

* CSS
* CSS3
* stylesheets
* responsive web design and media queries

##Project Creation Time
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the room look while the project is being completed? Are students in groups? Is there storyboarding? How are the teachers assisting? etc..~~

##Closing
The day ends with conversations about new things they learned, what tips they can put into practice with their next lesson and hopefully some comfort looking 'under the hood' with CSS on websites.

##Check for Understanding
Ideally, visual attention and presentation will improve for subsequent projects.

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

##Homework
No homework, though I'd encourage students to return to a previous project and refactor their CSS and spruce up presentation a bit, to practice what they've learned.
